# CISC479BearFactory

This was an in-class exercise from a class at the University of Delaware
CISC479-Introduction to Client-Side Engineering

This exercise has us creating a build-a-bear like website, where the user can create a custom bear, based on the bear's body type, outfit and accessories.  With a change to these bear attributes, the cost of the bear would be reflected in these changes.

The link below is to this active project, so you can see the behavior of the website, running in realtime.
